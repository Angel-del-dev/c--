# C--
This is not a serious language and its being developed
as my final project in my Vlang roadmap

## Syntax

This language doesn't contain {} to group
code blocks, instead it looks for indentation
just like python.
Every operation must end with ;

Every file must have one main function, which
will be the first function to be invoked

```
int main():
    /*
    * Functions are defined by:
    * return_type name(params):
    */
```

### Current features

* Variables:
  * int number = 2;
    * 'type name = value'
* Built-in-functions
  * print
    * Prints directly
  * println
    * Prints with a new line at the end
  * end
